                <h2>Welcome to K-Games&Collectables</h2>
                <p>K-Games&Collectables is a hobby/collectibles website that I'm building to share my love of games and collectibles with others.</p>
                <p>I'm very much addicted to Pokemon TCG, MTG, and board games. I made this small business to share my love of these hobbies with others.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>I used to have a webstore for K-Games&Collectables, but it was made in SquareSpace and I wanted more control over the website, as well as more cost effective.</p>
                <p>So for now, this website is still a massive work in progress, and will have to be moved to a more permanent home in the future. For now, its gonna just be a static site hosted through github pages</p>
                <br/>
                <p>This website for now will be used to serve as a blog place for me to be able to share new information about the website, as well as share my thoughts and ideas about the hobbies I love.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>I will also have a small store page on here, it wont be a full fledged cart and checkout system, instead it will just use a simple square payment link, which only allows for one product at a time to be purchased.</p>
                <p>If you would like to purchase a bunch of items, you may contact me through the contact page or through my <a href="mailto:support@kgamesncollctables.com">email</a>, and I will be able to create an invoice for your order!</p>
                <br/>
                <p>So for now, enjoy the site, and check back often for new content!</p>
