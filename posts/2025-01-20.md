## More Products

I have added a few more products to the store, including a few Pokemon booster packs, as well as some binders and such. More updates planned for the next few days!

## Product Links

These should hopefully work lol

-[Binders & Pages](https://kgamesncollectables.com/store#Pokemon#Accessories#Storage#Binders%20%26%20Pages)
-[Booster Packs](https://kgamesncollectables.com/store#Pokemon#Sealed%20Product#Booster%20Packs#)

## Other Stuff

If anyone has any products youd like to purchase that arent on the site, just remember to contact me and I can invoice you for it. I am not adding big products to the site, as the site is already just a temp site and using square payment link embeds, i can only set 1 shipping cost, which if i set it to accomodate big products, itll be too expensive for smaller products and if i set it to accomodate smaller products, it wont cover the cost of shipping big products. So bigger products as well as anything not on the site, or if you wanted to purchase multiple things on the site, just contact me and I can invoice you for it.

Reminder, use code `NEWYEARS2025` for 10% off until Jan 25th!

Thanks!
