## Website Overhaul with Bootstrap

I'm excited to share that I've made a significant update to the K-Games&Collectables website! After using custom CSS for quite some time, I've transitioned to using Bootstrap, a powerful CSS framework that will help make the site more responsive and functional, especially on the store page.

## Why the Change?

While custom CSS gave me full control over the website's design, it had some limitations when it came to creating a responsive layout that works well across all devices. The store page in particular needed better responsiveness for product cards and navigation elements. By implementing Bootstrap, I can leverage its grid system, components, and utilities to create a more professional and user-friendly experience.

### Key Improvements:

- **Better Navigation**: The tabbed navigation for store categories is now more intuitive and works better on mobile devices
- **Consistent Styling**: Buttons, forms, and other UI elements now have a consistent look and feel
- **Mobile-First Approach**: The entire site now responds better to different screen sizes, making shopping easier on phones and tablets

## Work in Progress

As you might notice, some product cards are currently missing from the store. This is because I'm in the process of reformatting all product listings to work with the new Bootstrap card system. I'll be adding them back over the next few days, so if you don't see a product you're looking for, it will be back soon!

In the meantime, if you're looking for something specific that isn't currently displayed, please don't hesitate to contact me directly through the [contact page](https://kgamesncollectables.com/contact.html) or via email. I can still process orders for any items that may not be visible on the site yet.

## Future Plans

This transition to Bootstrap is just the first step in a series of improvements I have planned for the store. The enhanced framework will allow me to add more dynamic features in the future!

I'm committed to making your shopping experience as seamless and enjoyable as possible, and these updates are a big step toward that goal.

As always, thank you for your patience and support as I continue to improve the K-Games&Collectables website!
