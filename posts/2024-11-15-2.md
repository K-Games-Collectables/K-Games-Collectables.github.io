## Canada Post Labour Disruption

Due to the current situation with Canada Post and their service disruptions, Shipping times are expected to be longer than usual. 
I will also offer shipping with another company, although this may result in higher shipping costs, due to the fact I have special offers with Canada Post via their Soloutions for Small Business program.
for more information feel free to send me an email to either [support@kgamesncollectables.com](mailto:support@kgamesncollectables.com?subject=Inquiry%20on%20Shipping%20Updates) or my personal email at [kaydonbob03@gmail.com](mailto:kaydonbob03@gmail.com?subject=Inquiry%20on%20Shipping%20Updates)

Thanks for your patience and understanding,
