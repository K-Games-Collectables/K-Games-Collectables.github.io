## Canada Post

As of last week, Canada Post has officially begun **rotating strike activity**, meaning mail is once again flowing through the system—but expect delays.  
Each week, different cities and regions will rotate between strike activity and regular operations, so please allow a few extra days for any packages or letters to arrive.  

Thank you for your patience and understanding as deliveries slowly return to normal.

## WE ARE OFFICIAL 🎉

I’m proud to officially announce that **K-Games & Collectables is now a registered business in Canada!**  
Our official business start date is set for **January 1st, 2026**, marking the beginning of our first fiscal year as a sole proprietorship.

This is a huge milestone that’s been in the works for months—thank you to everyone who’s supported K-Games & Collectables from its early hobby days to where it’s heading now.  
Registration allows us to grow more sustainably, prepare for tax filings, and work directly with suppliers and distributors as an official business.

## Site Changes

With business registration underway, the website is also going through some updates to prepare for our next phase.

### Store Page Changes

The **Store** section of our website will temporarily display an **“Under Construction”** message while we transition to our new Square-powered online store.  
Once ready, the existing Store page will automatically redirect to the Square storefront for a smoother shopping experience.

This change will simplify checkout, integrate with our POS system, and keep inventory synced between online and in-person sales.

### Future Plans

Here’s a little glimpse of what’s coming next:

- ✅ Integration between the Square store and our internal inventory system  
- ✅ Updated website navigation with clearer links and visuals  
- 🛠️ Improved product organization (TCG singles, sealed product, accessories, etc.)  
- 🧾 Enhanced receipts and loyalty features for returning customers  
- 💡 A modernized internal “Business Hub” for better management tools behind the scenes

As always, thank you for your patience and support as I continue to improve the K-Games & Collectables website and bring new features online!
