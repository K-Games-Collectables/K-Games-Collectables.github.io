## Resuming Operations: Important Information for Customers

I wanted to take a moment to update you on the current situation regarding Canada Post, as they will be restarting operations today, December 17. Hereâ€™s what you need to know:

Canada Post is beginning the process of safely ramping up and stabilizing operations across the country. With their extensive network of processing plants, depots, and post offices, it will take some time to fully stabilize operations, and they ask for your patience during this period

In light of this information, the shipping cost for payment links will be adjusted to CA$4.99. Please note that if the actual shipping cost exceeds this amount (for items like booster boxes, etc.), I may reach out to you to discuss whether you would prefer a refund and an invoice for the correct amount, or if you would like to cancel your order entirely. For now, I recommend purchasing only singles, booster packs, sleeves, toploaders, and similar items through this site, until i have the new ecommerce site and stuff up and running. For any other inquiries or purchases, feel free to email me at [support@kgamesncollectables.com](mailto:support@kgamesncollectables.com), and I will be happy to assist you


If you would like to request me to send an order via a different shipping company (i.e FedEx, UPS, etc...), I can quote you on what that shipping cost would be. Just once again email me or even send me a text at [705-999-3771](tel:7059993771)

### Key Points to Note

- **Initial Operations**: Canada Post will start by addressing the mail and parcels that have been trapped in the system since the strike began on November 15. New commercial volumes will not be accepted until Thursday, December 19. This means that for the first 48 hours, they will not pick up or accept any mail or parcels at their plants or depots. This time is necessary to safely reopen facilities and restart machines and vehicles that have been idle

- **Delivery Expectations**: As new volumes are accepted, mail and parcels will be processed on a first-in, first-out basis. Customers should expect delivery delays through the remainder of 2024 and into January 2025

### Important Information for Customers

To help you navigate the upcoming changes, here are the key points you need to know:

#### Parcels

- **Delays Expected**: Be prepared for delays and restrictions as Canada Post stabilizes operations, affecting pickups, drop-offs, and deliveries
- **Scheduled Pickups**: Scheduled pickups will start on December 19, but processing may take several days. Canada Post will strive to collect all items during the scheduled pickup; if they cannot, they will return to collect any remaining items either the same day or the next day

#### On-time Service Guarantees

- **Suspended Guarantees**: Currently, service guarantees are suspended. Canada Post will inform customers and businesses when these guarantees are reinstated

#### Return Labels and Call-for Items

- **Validity of Return Labels**: All return labels created on or after November 15 will remain valid for up to 45 days until operations stabilize
- **Pickup Timeframe**: Customers will have 15 days to pick up their parcels from post offices before they are returned to the sender

#### Package Redirection

- **Limited Fulfillment**: If you utilized Package Redirection during the strike, Canada Post will attempt to locate and redirect your parcel, but their ability to fulfill these requests will be limited until operations stabilize

#### International Mail and Parcels

- **Backlog Processing**: Canada Post will work to address the significant backlog of international mail and parcels. Expect delays into 2025, with new international mail being accepted starting December 23

#### Neighbourhood Mail

- **Service Resumption**: Date-specific Neighbourhood Mail is currently unavailable and will resume once operations stabilize. All other Neighbourhood Mail will be delivered as received

#### Transaction Mail

- **Service Standards Affected**: Service standards for Transaction Mail will be impacted in the short term, with trapped mail processed on a first-in, first-out basis

I appreciate your understanding and patience during this time. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me directly

Thank you for your continued support!
