## Store Update

Hey! Only 14 more days until christmas! Its an exciting time of the year!

I wont keep you here too long today, I just wanted to let you know that I have added a few more items to the store!

I have added a bunch of Hockey card singles from the Tim Hortons 2024-25 10th Edition set. I have more to go still. I also will be adding some pokemon singles and magic singles. It wont be like expensive cards or anything, but sometimes people even need the commons to complete sets, or decks, so its all good. I also want to push more sales of my K-Games&Colelctables Pokemon Mystery Bags. personally (i know im biased) but I think they are a great deal, and a great gift for the pokemon fan in your life. I also am working on maybe having MTG mystery bags as well, but the cost would be more considering the cost of packs is more than pokemon packs. 

I also am trying to sell off some bulk hockey cards, so if you are interested in that, let me know and we can work something out. I have a lot of cards that I dont need, and its far too many to individually add a payment link for each and every card lol. So definitely contact me if you are interested in that.

I may also be reworking the navigation of the store page, the sub-tabs and nested sub-tabs (sub-subtabs) are a bit buggy, I wish i was able to add a search feature as well, but ofc the limitations of a static website are a bit of a pain lol. But that is why im working on the new site. 

I do however start a new job next weekend, so I may not be able to work on the site as much as I would like, but I will try to keep up with it as much as I can.

I also have a few more things to add to the site, such as a FAQ page, and an about page, and maybe an events page, but we will see how that goes lol.

### Helpful Quick Links (If they work lol)

- [Store](https://kgamesncollectables.com/store.html)
- [K-Games&Collectables Pokemon Mystery Bags](https://kgamesncollectables.com/store#Pokemon#SealedProduct#MysteryProducts)
- [Card Sleeves](https://kgamesncollectables.com/store#Accessories#CardProtection#Sleeves)

### In Case quick links dont work

- K-Games&Collectables Pokemon Mystery Bags: store >> Pokemon >> Sealed Product >> Mystery Products
- I know the Card sleeves quick link and the toploaders quick link works, they are like the only ones that do
- Hockey Singles are straightforward: store >> Sports >> Hockey >> Tim Hortons 2024-25 (NOTE: None of the other sports card tabs are relevant and are either gonna be changed later, or removed entirely. Once again this site is temporary)
